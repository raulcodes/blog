I haven't posted here in a while, so I thought, what better way to start back up then to post
something I did over a year ago!  

I have been interested in the [Spotify Web API](![name](path/to/image.png#center)) for a while now. Specifically, their [Personalization API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-personalization) provides insights into a user's top listened-to tracks and artists at any time, not just when the end of the year rolls around and everyone gets their year in review.

I combined this interest with trying out [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework that I was hearing a lot about at the time I made this. And I think that it is well-known and liked for good reason. It made developing a production-ready web app a breeze. Combined with Vercel's easy deployment and hosting, and I barely had to think about anything other than React.

You can try the web app out for yourself here:
