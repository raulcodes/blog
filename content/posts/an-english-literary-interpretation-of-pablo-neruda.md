An episode of Radiolab titled ["100 Flowers"](https://www.radiolab.org/episodes/1000-flowers "100 Flowers") introduced me to the challenges of translating poetry. A strict word-by-word translation will likely leave poetic devices behind. At the same time, emphasizing the preservation of poetic devices over strict translation can result in losing the intended meaning of the poet. So, literary translators must perform a balancing act, trying to preserve the best of both. That’s not what I’m claiming to do here. I just had fun translating this poem, while trying to keep my perceived meaning in mind.

[Here’s a link to the poem in Spanish](https://www.neruda.uchile.cl/obra/obraodaselementales3.html "Oda al dia feliz"), my interpretation below:

## Ode to a happy day

> *Let me be happy,*  
> *this time*  
> *nothing has happened to no one,*  
> *I am no where,*  
> *the only thing that has happened,*  
> *is that I am happy*  
> *through the 4 chambers of the heart,*  
> *walking, sleeping or writing.*  
> *What else am I to do? I am*  
> *happy.*  
> *I’m more innumerable*  
> *than the meadow grass,*  
> *I feel my skin,*  
> *like the rough bark of a tree*  
> *and the water below,*  
> *the birds above,*  
> *the sea like a ring*  
> *around my waist,*  
> *the earth, made of bread and stone*  
> *the air sings like a guitar.*  

> *You, by side in the sand*  
> *you are the sand,*  
> *you sing and you are the song,*  
> *today the world is my soul,*  
> *song and sand,*  
> *today the world is your mouth,*  
> *in your mouth and in the sand,*  
> *let me be happy,*  
> *to be happy just because, because I breathe*  
> *and because you breathe,*  
> *to be happy because I touch*  
> *your knee*  
> *and it is as if I touch*  
> *the blue skin of the sky,*  
> *and feel its freshness.*  

> *Today, leave me, alone,*  
> *to be happy*  
> *with or without everyone else,*  
> *to be happy with the grass*  
> *and the sand,*  
> *to be happy*  
> *with the air and the land,*  
> *to be happy,*  
> *with you, with your mouth,*  
> *to be happy.*
