Quarantine haircuts have been rough. I have been a fan of five panel hats for a long time, but my DIY haircuts in the past year have had me reaching for my hat shelf more often than not recently. 

Years ago, I found \[APE & BIRD\]([https://www.apenbird.com/](https://www.apenbird.com/ "Ape & Bird")), a business run by a two person crew in Providence, Rhode Island. They pride themselves on making small batch caps, beanies, and other accessories. This pride carries over into whoever wears their stuff. I absolutely love their hats. Iâ€™m on my third five panel hat of theirs, which I bought a couple of weeks ago when they refreshed their designs after a well-deserved winter break off. 

On top of being well-made and beautiful, their hats include my favorite feature of any hat ever: a pencil holder! On the right side of each hat (they move it to the left by request, for my left-handed self), they stitch a loop that will fit a pencil or pen, making it easy to always have a writing utensil on hand. 

Early in 2020, when mask-wearing was still a relatively new thing, they developed and posted plans for a bandana mask for free on their website. I love that they engage and are part of their community in an authentic way. Iâ€™m happy to support them, and look forward to my next five panel purchase ðŸ˜‰
