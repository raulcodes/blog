I spend more time typing on a keyboard than doing just about anything else in a day. Despite this, I have never been able to take the same kind of thoughtful, stream-of-consciousness type 
notes on a keyboard that I write in a notebook. 

One day, while procrastinating on a programming assignment in college, I found a [video](https://youtu.be/gVUVUoXrPzM) (reupload) of a designer named Aaron Draplin doing a logo design 
challenge. I love watching people do things they excel at, so I was really enjoying this video.
While looking more into Aaron, I learned that he co-founded a company called [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com). Field Notes are small notebooks, inspired by Draplin’s own massive 
collection of agricultural memo books. Check out some of his collection on their [website](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/from-seed). Since finding them, I’ve loved collecting them and I 
can’t get enough. I became such a big fan of theirs, that I made the swag item of Freetail Hackers, a student organization at UT Austin that organizes hackathons, a custom Field Notes 
journal in 2016.
