summary: "A few thoughts about 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich' by Leo Tolstoy"
---

I just finished this short story by Leo Tolstoy. I forget where it was recommended to me, probably Reddit. It was brutal. It was short, about 100 pages. 
I was really surprised at how relatable the writing was. Despite the fact that it was written in the late 1800’s, it often felt like Ivan’s life would fit in today. 

Ivan values his career, many times above other aspects of his life. He marries because he believes that is the right thing to do. So many of his actions are done because of that. As his marriage sours, he relies more and more on his career. He advances and becomes a well-respected and paid judge. 

I feel like the process of getting and decorating his family’s new home was one of the few times when Ivan showed some real joy. He downplays the state of the home to his family, hoping for surprised reactions from them. He enjoyed buying and decorating the home. But he fell off a ladder and bumped his side, the beginning of his decline. 

He’s frustrated with doctors. In the absence of his work, his soured marriage is strained further. He hates a lot. 

He questions if he lived life the right way. 
He wants to be coddled. He wants to weep and be embraced. He makes a caretaker, Gerasim, a person of comfort to him. Gerasim holds Ivan’s legs on his shoulders, as it comforts Ivan. 

I feel grateful to have been able to have read this book. It is making me think about life in a grander way. It seems like I’m so offend zoomed in on days, this short story helped me zoom out a bit and think it over. Thank you Leo Tolstoy.
